* Character and Animation Assets were found ready-made on the internet.
* Animation Assets were sliced into 64-128 pieces. and was added to the main project with the animation section.
* By adding rigidbody and box collision to the character and box collision to Ground, the problems that may occur as a result of collisions have been solved.

this game developed with Unity and C#
will be upgrade (Blender can be used for environment and section design and also 3D/2D Character Model Design)

in this Lecture I learned OpenGL and DirectX , Blender for Design and  little Unity (some animations vs.)
while I develop this project Unity and C# I learned some specific information and Lots of math and analytical geometry
